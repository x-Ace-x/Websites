    <h1>Top 5 DPS Characters in Genshin Impact</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            Over the last three years, Genshin Impact has released a lot of characters across four different nations. With seven elements and five different weapons, the option for HoYoverse is endless when it comes to creating a new unit. Hence, similar to any Gacha game, Genshin Impact has two rarities for characters, including 5-stars and 4-stars.
            The following article will list all the 5-star characters available until the v3.8 update and rank them based on their prowess, utility, and value in a team. From elemental reactions to supporting their fellow party members, some can be slotted to any team formation, and some are still very lackluster in the game.

        <h2>
            List of Top 5 DPS Characters:
        </h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>5) Raiden Shogun</h3>
        <p>
            Raiden Shogun, at first, wasn’t the most capable character in the game because of the fact that the Electro element wasn’t too strong. However, as players began to learn how to properly utilize her, she became an instant killer and is now one of the best characters in Genshin Impact.
        
        </p>
        <p>
            Used best as a support character, Raiden Shogun is a powerful character that can generate a good amount of energy. This makes her very useful in a lot of different teams, as she is quite versatile thanks to her overall abilities as a character.And in regards too her damage poteintal , she is at her peak with the national team which includes xingqui,xiangling,and bennett

    <div>
        <h3>4) Xiao</h3>
        <p>
            Xiao can be quite odd in the sense that he is the only Anemo character that is focused on his DPS role. Still, he is a great character to use if you want a good DPS character on your side because he can deal considerable damage with attacks that can hit multiple enemies in one strike.

        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, a good combo to use Xiao with is the Elemental Reaction Swirl, which he can trigger with a lot of different characters. This means that Xiao can find a roster spot on any party in this game, especially if you have multiple characters that can trigger Swirl with him.
            You might find it difficult to play around Xiao at first but once you know him it just gets better .

        <h3>3) Alhaitham</h3>
        <p>
            Alhaitham is a Dendro sword user and a powerful damage dealer from Sumeru in Genshin Impact.Alhaitham is a DPS in Genshin Impact. Alhaitham DPS Build is mainly used.  Alhaitham mainly deals DMG with his Normal Attack Infused with Dendro Element, Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst.

    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>2) Hu tao</h3>
        <p>
            Hu Tao is a Pyro character that wields a polearm and is capable of dealing a lot of damage when you use the right build. A lot of different players love the fact that Hu Tao can deal a lot of damage against single targets.

        </p>
        <p>
            Even though she doesn't deal the same damage that Diluc, this five-star character is better at damaging opponents one-on-one. As such, she is a very valuable character that any team can find a place for, especially if they're looking for characters that can deal insane amounts of damage.

    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>4) Kamisato Ayaka</h3>
        <p>
            Ayaka joined the roster after the Genshin Impact 2.0 update,and she was able to meet expectations. Ayaka is a Cryo sword user and was able to impress people with her DPS, although she doesn't deal the same damage that Diluc or Ganuy can deal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nevertheless, what makes her a better character is the fact that she can also fill a secondary role if you have a better DPS character on your roster, and she still shines well enough in that role. That said, she is a useful character that can fit different roles in the game, and that is why she is on this list.
